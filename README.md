# Modular Universal Jamming Gripper
We are developing a modular universal jamming gripper that will allow robots to easily pick up a variety of objects. The gripper is controlled via a 1/4" air hose and features t-slot compatibility. An accompanying control box houses the air pump, direction control valve, and motor control board. The system runs on 5V logic and a 12V motor supply.
